# Island RTL


Island RTL is the small core run time library for the [Island](http://docs.elementscompiler.com/Platforms/Island/) platform of the [Elements](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/) compiler. It provides a basic class and type system, including the `Object` type, which is the ancestor of any classes you define yourself, as well as simple types such as `String`, `DateTime`, core collection classes, Exception handling (and the base `Exception` class) and more. 

Island RTL (`Island.fx`) ships precompiled with the Elements compiler, and new projects created with one of the Island project templates will automatically have a reference to the library. Should you need to add a reference manually, you can do so via the [Add References](http://docs.elementscompiler.com/Projects/References) dialog in Fire or Visual Studio, where the `Island.fx` library should show automatically.

The code for this library is open source and available under a liberal license. We appreciate contributions.
