'''<Summary>This example shows a variety of different uses of object stores, from updating the data structure with IDBObjectStore.createIndex inside an onupgradeneeded function, to adding a new item to our object store with IDBObjectStore.add. For a full working example, see our To-do Notifications app (view example live.)</Summary>
