Public Interface [XRInputSourceEvent]
  '''<Summary>An XRFrame object providing the needed information about the event frame during which the event occurred. This frame may have been rendered in the past rather than being a current frame. Because this is an event frame, not an animation frame, you cannot call the XRFrame method getViewerPose() on it; instead, use getPose().</Summary>
  ReadOnly Property [frame] As XRFrame
