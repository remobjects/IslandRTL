  '''<Summary>An object describing the relying party which requested the credential creation.</Summary>
  Property [rp] As String
  '''<Summary>An object describing the user account for which the credential is generated.</Summary>
  Property [user] As String
  '''<Summary>A BufferSource, emitted by the relying party's server and used as a cryptographic challenge. This value will be signed by the authenticator and the signature will be sent back as part of AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.attestationObject.</Summary>
  Property [challenge] As BufferSource
  '''<Summary>An Array of element which specify the desired features of the credential, including its type and the algorithm used for the cryptographic signature operations. This array is sorted by descending order of preference.</Summary>
  Property [pubKeyCredParams] As String
  '''<Summary>A numerical hint, in milliseconds, which indicates the time the caller is willing to wait for the creation operation to complete. This hint may be overridden by the browser.</Summary>
  Property [timeout] As Long
  '''<Summary>An Array of descriptors for existing credentials. This is provided by the relying party to avoid creating new public key credentials for an existing user who already have some.</Summary>
  Property [excludeCredentials] As String
  '''<Summary>An object whose properties are criteria used to filter out the potential authenticators for the creation operation.</Summary>
  Property [authenticatorSelection] As String
  '''<Summary>A String which indicates how the attestation (for the authenticator's origin) should be transported.</Summary>
  Property [attestation] As String
  '''<Summary>An object with several client extensions' inputs. Those extensions are used to request additional processing (e.g. dealing with legacy FIDO APIs credentials, prompting a specific text on the authenticator, etc.).</Summary>
