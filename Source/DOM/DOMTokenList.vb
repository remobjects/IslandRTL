'''<Summary>The DOMTokenList interface represents a set of space-separated tokens. Such a set is returned by Element.classList, HTMLLinkElement.relList, HTMLAnchorElement.relList, HTMLAreaElement.relList, HTMLIframeElement.sandbox, or HTMLOutputElement.htmlFor. It is indexed beginning with 0 as with JavaScript Array objects. DOMTokenList is always case-sensitive.</Summary>
