  Property [localCandidateId] As String
  '''<Summary>A Boolean value which, if true, indicates that the candidate pair described by this object is one which has been proposed for use, and will be (or was) used if its priority is the highest among the nominated candidate pairs. See RFC 5245, section 7.1.3.2.4 for details.</Summary>
  Property [nominated] As Boolean
