'''<summary>The ConstrainBoolean dictionary is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a Boolean value. You can specify an exact value which must be matched, an ideal value that should be matched if at all possible, and a fallback value to attempt to match once all more specific constraints have been applied.</summary>
